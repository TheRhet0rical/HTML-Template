# **Base HTML Website Template** 🌐
*Created and maintained By Rhet0rical.*

## **Description** 🗒️
Just a basic website template that I created so I don't have to go back and re-create a website over and over again for every web project I do. Also prizes organization, too.

## **Features** 😎
It features a ```index.html```, along with a ```script.js``` and ```style.css``` already coded into the base HTML. It also has a favicon example favicon linked into it. It also has an ``assets`` folder to hold some extra website assets if needed.

Also, for me **personally**, I included an organized CSS format. Just simple comments telling you where certain things should be. Keeps everything nice and tidy.
